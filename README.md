# Arrays, Objects and Loops Daily Project


In this project, your task is to complete the unfinished functions. Instructions accompany each function explaining 
what the function should do and what value it should return. You will implement logic using loops, conditional statements, 
arrays, and objects to return the values specified in the instructions.

All of the function tasks can be found in script.js.

The test.js file contains tests for all of the functions in this project. Do not change any code in test.js. To see the output 
from test.js and to evaluate your work, open index.html in Chrome and view the console in the Developer Tools. You'll know 
that you are finding success when all of the console.log statements print 'true'.
